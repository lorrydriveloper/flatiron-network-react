<p><b>***************************************************************</b></p>
<p><span>Founded in February 2009 as NxtGenUG, we changed our name in 2013 to SmartDevs and in 2019 we moved to Ludlow.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p>We meet on the 2nd Monday of each month in Ludlow between 7pm and 9pm for a presentation and pizza.&nbsp; All are welcome.</p>
<p>Please register first so we can get the pizza order right (and let us know if you have specific food requirements).</p>
<p>The group welcomes speakers from all over the UK and sometimes even a famous overseas visitor. Although a lot of the talks are based around Microsoft technology we’ll cover anything interesting to a tech audience, from <span>.net,</span> JavaScript through C# to swarming quad-copters controlled from a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>If you’d like to speak about a technology that you’ve found interesting but are not sure you have enough content for a whole session we’ll make room for ten minutes at the start.</p>

<p>Our passion is learning. as we reach adulthood, attending a learning environment so often comes at a cost. any cost is a barrier. We believe in providing the opportunity for adults to learn how to create great digital experiences; whether that’s writing an app for a smartphone or creating a website for fun.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we provide that opportunity without the barriers; We don’t sell you anything and we won't charge you anything. We’ll give you a way to learn digital skills in a fun, friendly and inclusive environment.</p>
<p>All we ask is to bring along your enthusiasm a drive to learn something new.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions on what you would like to see in these sessions, or if you would like to join us as a mentor, please use the discussion section and an organiser will get back to you :)</p>`,

<p>The tech industry is as much ours for the taking and making as anyone's! Whether we are raising our families, running our own businesses or are building careers we can all thrive through tech. </p>
<p>But there is a gap. Women in tech are severely underrepresented in the industry that is shaping our world. This is a risk to our financial security, flexibility and fulfilment. </p>
<p>So we are reinventing the concept of a tech hub/meet-up to demystify digital technology and drive up diversity, innovation and imagination from women in tech. </p>
<p>Our plan is three-fold: <br>1) Get more women excited and informed about converting to careers in tech. <br>2) Teach practical skills that design and future proof careers/businesses with tech , <br>2) Build peer and mentor support networks that generate opportunities for women to thrive through tech in life and work.</p>
<p>This is a University of Chester Shrewsbury Campus initiative who are committed to co-creating an inclusive sustainable digital economy through this network. </p>
<p>**This is an inclusive, warm and friendly group for women and people who present as a women and/or non binary as well as people who are committed to supporting women to thrive through tech***</p>
<p>** WARNING - HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT HUGS &amp; HAPPINESS MAY HAPPEN HERE***</p>`,
